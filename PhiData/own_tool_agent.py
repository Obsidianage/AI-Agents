Writing your own Tools
For more control, write your own python functions and add them as tools to an Agent. For example, hereâ€™s how to add a get_top_hackernews_stories tool to an Agent.

# Although this code is not working as expected, it is a good starting point for writing your own tools.
# The problem is that DuckDuckGO is not able to search the web for the content of the blog posts.
# It is only able to search the web for the title of the blog posts.
# So, we need to use a different tool to search the web for the content of the blog posts.
